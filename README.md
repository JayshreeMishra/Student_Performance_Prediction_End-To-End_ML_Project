# **Student Performance Prediction End-To-End ML Project**

### Introduction

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict student performance in mathematics based on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course. The project is built using an end-to-end machine learning approach and includes a web application for user interaction.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to forecast the math scores of students using a dataset from Kaggle titled ["Students Performance in Exams"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977). The project analyzes how different variables affect student performance.

### Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/Student_Performance_Prediction_End-To-End_ML_Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Student_Performance_Prediction_End-To-End_ML_Project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Web Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web App:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the web application.

### Usage

- Once the web application is running, you can input various parameters such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course to predict the student's math score.
- The application will display the predicted score based on the input parameters.

### Known Issues and Limitations

- This project uses a specific dataset, and the performance may vary with different datasets.
- The predictions' accuracy depends on the training data's quality and diversity.


### Contributing

- Contributions are welcome If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Understanding the Project

This machine learning project aims to understand how various factors such as:
- **Gender**
- **Ethnicity**
- **Parental level of education**
- **Lunch**
- **Test preparation course**

affect students' math scores. By analyzing these variables, the project provides insights into the factors influencing student mathematics performance.
